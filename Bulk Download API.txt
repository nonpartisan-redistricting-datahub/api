Bulk Download API
Ability for administrative-level users to make bulk downloads of the files offered for each state.
Authentication
All endpoints accept params &username= and &password= which are the username and password to log in.
The resulting combination must be valid to log in to Wordpress, and the user must have download-api permission. That is, they must be assigned the API Download user role in WP Admin.
Escaping URL params
All URL params must be encoded in the usual fashion, e.g. %20 or + in lieu of spaces.
Example of encoding special characters in password:
?username=testperson&password=My%20Secret%20Password

Listing Files
URL: https://redistrictingdatahub.org/wp-json/download/list
Returns a list of all files currently offered on the website, in a variety of formats.
Params:
* &username= -- Login credentials, as described above.
* &password= -- Login credentials, as described above.
* &format= -- The format of the returned listing. Any of: json csv
Return:
* Varies depending on the &format= parameter. See Examples below.
Examples:
# return the list as a JSON-encoded array, including metadata
curl --output filelist.json 'https://redistrictingdatahub.org/wp-json/download/list?username=X&password=X&format=json'


# return the list as CSV text, including metadata
curl --output filelist.csv 'https://redistrictingdatahub.org/wp-json/download/list?username=X&password=X&format=csv'


Downloading a File
URL: https://redistrictingdatahub.org/wp-json/download/file/FILENAME
Downloads a file by giving a redirect. If the file is on the private S3 bucket, then the redirect will be to a S3-signed URl good for 5 minutes. Otherwise, the redirect is simply to the file on the remote website.
Params:
* &username= -- Login credentials, as described above.
* &password= -- Login credentials, as described above.
* The FILENAME is specified in the URL, and not as a query string parameter.
Return:
* None. A redirect is given to the stated file, and it is expected that the cller will follow the redirect and download the file.
Examples:
curl --location --output output_filename.zip 'https://redistrictingdatahub.org/wp-json/download/file/the_filename.zip?username=X&password=X'


See the listing output for examples.
Other Limitations & Caveats
Files Listing is Based on Website Content
The files listed by the download/list API is is not directly based on the contents of the S3 bucket. It is a listing of files set up to be offered on State pages.
This means a few caveats:
* Files may be present on S3 which are not offered on any of the State pages. These files would not be present in the API listing. However, if you know the file path then you could still download it via the download/file API.
* If a file's URL is entered incorrectly and does not match a real file URL on S3, the listing will still contain this incorrect URL, and of course download will fail.
Plugin Compatiblity
Some security enhancement plugins may cause incompatibility, as they try to protect the API endpoints.
The Password Protected plugin, by default has Allow REST API Access turned off and will result in a code 401 "Only authenticated users can access the REST API." Enable this option to enable API requests outside of Wordpress.
