# API
This repo contains two files:

1. Jupyter notebook with API retrieval script.
2. README from GreenInfo (our web developers) with additional information on the WordPress API.

The script in this repo can be used to extract data from the RDH API. Designated API users can "Run All" and fill out the prompts as needed (e.g. username, password, states of interest, filtering paramters, etc.). You should not have to modify any of the code to retrieve data from the API, which will be extracted to the directory in which this script is housed on your system. You must be a designated API user by RDH in order for the script to work, this is a different status than a normal, verified account.

If you have any questions or requests about/for the script, accessing RDH data, or becoming a designated API user, please contact info@redistrictingdatahub.org.
